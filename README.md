# xwipeoutx-pihole
Just my blocklists for piholes

## Why did I do this? 

Instead of just using, like, https://firebog.net/?

Well, I just wanted control/vetting at this level, and have... different... requirements to the original

## Can I use this?

Sure. Dunno if I'd recommend it, but sure.

See https://github.com/jacklul/pihole-updatelists for the docker image I used to do exactly that.
